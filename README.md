# Tree-FSSN
Final examinations of Algorithm and Data Structure of Computer Science, A.A 2022-2023, University of Florence. <br><br>
This project was assigned during the course of Algorithm and Data Structure and is an implemation in Java of an m-ary tree located and managed by a binary tree rappresented First-Son-Son-Next.



<div>The data structure include 2 important classes:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>NodoPFFS, that contain the data and the pointer to the first son, next brother and the father.</li>
    <li>AlberoPFFS, that contain the pointer to the root and the information of th tree (height, num of leaf, numero of element).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Implemention and functionality
  <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Insert the root of which the information it contains is known</li>
    <li>Insert in T a new node V as child of a node U</li>
    <li>Insert a new root into a non-empty T tree so that the old root is daughter</li>
    <li>Depth-first search of the tree</li>
    <li>Breadth-first search of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the number of elements of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the number of children from a node</li>
    <li>Return the information list of his children from a node</li>
    <li>Return the information of a node</li>
    <li>Change the information of a node</li>
    <li>Return the root of a tree</li>
    <li>Return the father of a node</li>
    <li>Return the number of leaf of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the height of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the level of a node</li>
    <li>Return the string of the tree when the brother of a node are close with square brackets and separate by comma. Example: A[B[E, F], C[G[H, I, L, M]], D]</li>
  </ol>
</div>
