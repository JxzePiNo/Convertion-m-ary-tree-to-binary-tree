# Convert a m-ary tree to binary tree
Final examinations for Algorithm and Data Structure in Computer Science, A.Y. 2022-2023, University of Florence. <br><br>
This project was assigned during the Algorithm and Data Structure course and involves the implementation in Java of an m-ary tree located and managed within a binary tree.



<div>The data structure include 2 important classes:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>NodoPFFS, which contains the data and pointers to the first child, next brother and the father.</li>
    <li>AlberoPFFS, which contains the pointer to the root and information about the tree (height, number of leaves, number of elements).
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Implemention and functionality:
  <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Insert the root node, where the information it contains is known</li>
    <li>Insert in T a new node V as child of a node U</li>
    <li>Insert a new root into a non-empty tree T so that the old root becomes a daughter.</li>
    <li>Depth-first search of the tree</li>
    <li>Breadth-first search of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the number of elements in the tree</li>
    <li>Return the number of children of a node</li>
    <li>Return the information list of its children from a node</li>
    <li>Return the information of a node</li>
    <li>Change the information of a node</li>
    <li>Return the root of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the father of a node</li>
    <li>Return the number of leaves in the tree</li>
    <li>Return the height of the tree</li>
    <li>Return the level of a node</li>
    <li>Return the string of the tree when the brother of a node are enclose in square brackets and separate by comma. <br>Example: A[B[E, F], C[G[H, I, L, M]], D]</li>
  </ol>
</div>
